## üîç Why Domain Shift Happens

### Task09_Spleen Characteristics
- Single-organ focused (spleen only)
- Specific CT protocol
- Well-controlled acquisition
- Consistent preprocessing

### TotalSegmentator Characteristics
- Whole-body CT scans
- Multiple CT protocols
- Various hospitals & scanners
- Different preprocessing
- Greater anatomical variation

**Result**: Model learned Task09-specific patterns, not generalizable features.

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Overfitting to Domain**
   - Model achieves Dice 0.88 on training domain
   - Performance drops to 0.46 on different domain
   - Shows poor generalization

2. **High Variability**
   - Task09: 19.2% variability (consistent)
   - TotalSeg: 73.0% variability (inconsistent)
   - 3.8x MORE variable on different domain!

3. **Confidence vs Accuracy**
   - Model has high confidence on both domains
   - But accuracy differs significantly
   - Confidence ‚â† Reliability under domain shift

4. **Specificity is Strong**
   - Specificity: 0.9999 on both datasets
   - Model rarely makes false positives
   - Good at identifying non-spleen regions

5. **Sensitivity is Weak**
   - Task09: Sensitivity 0.89+ (good)
   - TotalSeg: Sensitivity 0.39 (poor)
   - Model misses many spleen voxels on TotalSeg

## ‚úÖ What Works Well

1. **On Task09_Spleen**
   - Consistent performance (19% variability)
   - High Dice (0.88)
   - 90% excellent cases
   - Learned patterns specific to this domain

2. **General Properties**
   - High specificity (0.9999)
   - Few false positives
   - Stable across both domains
   - No crashes or errors

---

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

1. **On TotalSegmentator**
   - Low average Dice (0.46)
   - High variability (73%)
   - Only 30% excellent cases
   - Patterns don't transfer

2. **Generalization**
   - Model overfit to Task09
   - Doesn't handle domain shift
   - Sensitive to protocol differences
   - Not reliable on different data

## üéì Lessons Learned

### For ML Practitioners
1. **Always validate on target domain**
   - Pre-trained models ‚â† production-ready
   - Domain shift is common and significant

2. **Domain-specific patterns matter**
   - Model learned Task09 specifics
   - Patterns don't generalize to other domains

3. **Variability is as important as accuracy**
   - High variability = unreliable
   - TotalSeg's 73% variability is problematic

4. **Confidence ‚â† Accuracy**
   - Model confident on both domains
   - But accuracy differs by 47.7%

## üîß Solutions

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- Fine-tune on TotalSegmentator subset
- Expected Dice: 0.75-0.85

### Medium-term (1-2 months)
- Domain adaptation techniques
- Transfer learning optimization
- Multi-domain training

### Long-term (2+ months)
- Retrain from scratch on TotalSegmentator
- Use full dataset (1204 cases)
- Expected Dice: 0.85-0.92

---

## üìà Recommendation

### ‚ùå DO NOT
Use this model directly on TotalSegmentator

### ‚úÖ DO
1. Fine-tune on TotalSegmentator
2. Or retrain from scratch
3. Always validate on target domain
4. Monitor variability, not just mean accuracy
